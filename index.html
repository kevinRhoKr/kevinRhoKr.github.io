				    	While reading this writing, I noticed that there were many themes that came up. 
				    	<br>
				    	There was a theme about going against the sterotype and discrimination to become a successful digital artist. 
				    	<br> 
				    	There was also a theme about how advances in technology can lead to more different and interesting form of art. 
				    	<br> 
				    	And I thought it was really interesting, because I've also thought of art (as someone who never studied arts before) as something very traditional and conservative. 
				    	<br>
				    	But this writing allowed me to realize that art is very dynamic and is not constraint to just paints and brushes.
